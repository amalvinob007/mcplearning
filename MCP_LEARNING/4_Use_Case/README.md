# 4_Use_Case

This folder contains three different versions of MCP use case implementations:

- **v1**: Backend-only version.
- **v2**: Frontend version with basic UI.
- **v3_final**: The final, complete version with both backend and frontend, including the full user interface (UI).

For the full experience, use the `v3_final` folder.
